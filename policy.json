    "policy_name": "Guarding U.S. Medicare Against Rising Drug Costs (GUARD) Model",
    "effective_date": "2027-01-01",
    "duration": "Seven-year model period, consisting of a five-year performance period (January 1, 2027 – December 31, 2031) for rebate obligations, followed by a two-year period for invoicing, payment, and reconciliation (until December 31, 2033).",

    "policy_structure": [
        "The Guarding U.S. Medicare Against Rising Drug Costs (GUARD) Model is a mandatory Most Favored Nation (MFN) drug pricing demonstration model under Medicare Part D.",
        "It requires manufacturers of eligible sole-source drugs and biologics to pay rebates based on the difference between the Medicare Net Price and an International Pricing Benchmark.",
        "The model targets specific therapeutic categories and drugs exceeding a minimum Part D spend threshold, excluding generics, biosimilars, and drugs with a Medicare Maximum Fair Price.",
        "CMS will randomly select geographic areas, covering approximately 25% of Part D enrollees, for participation.",
        "The model has a five-year performance period (2027-2031) for rebate obligations, followed by a two-year period for invoicing and reconciliation, concluding in December 2033."
    ],
    "drug_eligibility_criteria": "Drugs covered under GUARD must be sole-source drugs and biologics that are subject to Medicare Part D inflation rebates and fall within certain specified drug classes in the USP Medicare Model Formulary Guidelines. \"Sole source drugs\" include single-source drugs approved under an NDA (including authorized generics with no therapeutic equivalents) and biologics approved under a BLA (including unbranded biologics that are not a reference biologic for a biosimilar application). There are 17 included USP drug classes, such as Analgesics, Antineoplastics, and Immunological Agents. Excluded drugs are generics approved under an ANDA, biosimilars licensed under section 351(k) of the Public Health Service Act, drugs selected for Medicare Maximum Fair Price (MFP) negotiation while the MFP is in effect, and drugs that do not meet a minimum Part D spend threshold ($69 million for 2027, adjusted annually for inflation). GUARD drugs that become multi-source during a performance year would no longer be subject to GUARD after that point. Units purchased under the 340B Drug Discount Program and units associated with compounded drugs are also excluded from rebate calculations.",
    "international_pricing_benchmark": "The GUARD Model's per-unit International Pricing Benchmark is the greater of two alternatives: a \"Default\" Benchmark (Method I) or an \"Updated\" Benchmark (Method II). The Default Benchmark is determined by CMS using foreign pricing data (e.g., IQVIA MIDAS, Eversana NAVLIN, Global Data POLI) from the 12 months prior to a performance year. CMS calculates a volume-weighted or straight average price for the NDC-9 analog in each of 19 reference countries and selects the lowest country average. This benchmark is fixed once set for a drug and adjusted by 102%. The Updated Benchmark is derived from foreign net pricing data voluntarily submitted by manufacturers within 180 days after the end of a performance year. Manufacturers provide data for all analogs in the 19 reference countries, using either a \"streamlined\" or \"limited\" option, from which CMS calculates a cross-country volume-weighted average net price. This benchmark can change annually with submissions and is adjusted by 105%. Both benchmarks are adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) using GDP per capita. The 19 reference countries are OECD members with a PPP-adjusted per-capita GDP of at least 60% of the U.S. and an annual GDP of at least $400 billion.",
    "benchmark_comparison": "The GUARD Model's International Pricing Benchmark is determined by selecting the greater value between the Default (Method I) and Updated (Method II) benchmarks. The Default Benchmark (Method I) relies on CMS-obtained foreign pricing data, typically reflecting list prices, and identifies the *lowest* country average price among the 19 reference nations. Once established for a drug, this benchmark remains constant throughout the model's duration and is subject to a 102% adjuster. In contrast, the Updated Benchmark (Method II) is based on *voluntarily submitted manufacturer net pricing data*, which allows for a *cross-country volume-weighted average net price*. This benchmark can be updated annually and receives a higher 105% adjuster, intended to incentivize manufacturer data submission. Manufacturers must strategically assess whether their drug's international pricing and discounting favor the potentially lower list prices of Method I or the higher cross-country average net price (with a greater adjuster) of Method II. Both methods utilize the same set of 19 OECD reference countries, ensuring consistency in the geographical scope of the comparison.",
    "enforcement_and_penalties": "Failure by a manufacturer to timely pay the incremental GUARD Model rebate amount within 30 calendar days after receiving the final or reconciliation report will result in a Civil Monetary Penalty (CMP) equal to 125% of the unpaid rebate (or reconciled amount). This CMP is in addition to the underlying rebate owed. Manufacturers who knowingly fail to comply with GUARD Model requirements, including provisions in the data agreement, are also subject to CMPs. The notice, hearing, and appeal procedures for CMPs are consistent with those under the Part D inflation rebate program. CMS also reserves the right to take additional enforcement actions, such as terminating the data agreement, requiring additional information, or subjecting the manufacturer to increased monitoring or auditing. Non-compliance cases may also be referred to the HHS Office of the Inspector General, the Department of Justice, or the Treasury Department for further review and investigation.",
    "what_you_need_to_know": [
        "Participation in the GUARD Model is mandatory for manufacturers of eligible Part D drugs, with no enrollment procedure required.",
        "The model's primary goal is to reduce Medicare Part D spending, with only indirect impacts, if any, on beneficiary out-of-pocket costs.",
        "Rebates are calculated as the excess of the Medicare Net Price over an International Pricing Benchmark, reduced by any existing Part D inflation rebate.",
        "Manufacturers can choose to voluntarily submit international net pricing data (Method II), which uses a cross-country weighted average and a 105% adjuster, or rely on CMS's default benchmark (Method I), which uses the lowest country average and a 102% adjuster.",
        "Eligible drugs are sole-source drugs and biologics in 17 specified therapeutic categories, meeting a minimum Part D spend threshold ($69 million for 2027), while generics, biosimilars, and drugs with a Medicare Maximum Fair Price are excluded.",
        "The model will be implemented in randomly selected geographic areas (ZCTAs) covering approximately 25% of Medicare Part D beneficiaries.",
        "Manufacturers have no appeal rights regarding CMS's selection of drugs, beneficiaries, geographic areas, or the calculation of the total rebate amount, but Civil Monetary Penalties can be appealed."
    ],
    "implications_for_pharma_companies": [
        "**Increased Rebate Liability**: Manufacturers of eligible Part D drugs will face additional mandatory rebate obligations, potentially increasing their financial burden beyond existing Part D inflation rebates.",
        "**Complex Pricing Decisions**: Companies must strategically evaluate whether to submit voluntary international net pricing data (Method II) or rely on CMS's default benchmark (Method I), considering the different calculation methodologies, adjustment factors, and potential impact on rebate amounts.",
        "**Significant Data Burden**: Opting for Method II requires substantial resources for collecting, calculating, and submitting granular international net pricing data across 19 reference countries, a complex and resource-intensive task.",
        "**Pressure on Gross-to-Net Revenue**: The imposition of these new rebates is expected to exert considerable pressure on manufacturers' gross-to-net revenue, potentially impacting profitability, R&D investments, and overall financial planning.",
        "**High Penalties for Non-Compliance**: Failure to timely pay rebates or comply with model requirements can result in severe Civil Monetary Penalties (125% of the unpaid rebate) and other enforcement actions, including data agreement termination.",
        "**Limited Recourse**: The absence of appeal rights for key CMS determinations (e.g., drug selection, rebate calculation) means manufacturers have limited legal avenues to challenge adverse decisions, increasing regulatory risk.",
        "**Potential for Indirect Price Adjustments**: While not directly affecting beneficiary costs, the model may indirectly incentivize manufacturers to adjust U.S. net prices to mitigate rebate liabilities, influencing market access and commercial strategies."
