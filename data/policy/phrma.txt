WASHINGTON, D.C. (December 19, 2025) – Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Chief Public Affairs Officer & Head of Strategic Initiatives Robby Zirkelbach issued the following statement on today’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announcement on the GUARD and GLOBE Proposed Rules:
 
“Government policies that mandate broad-based foreign price controls are bad for American patients and undermine U.S. leadership. By CMS’ own admission, the proposed policies are projected to increase costs for America’s seniors, and they will siphon billions from U.S. medicine R&D at a time when China is on the verge of surpassing us.”
