A "sole source drug" is defined as a single source drug (NDA-approved with no therapeutic equivalents) or a biologic (BLA-licensed, not a reference for a biosimilar). Eligible drugs must also meet a minimum Part D spend threshold, set at $69 million for 2027 and adjusted annually for inflation. Excluded drugs include generics approved under ANDA, biosimilars, drugs selected for Medicare Maximum Fair Price (MFP) negotiation, drugs that do not meet the minimum Part D spend threshold, and drugs that become multi-source during a performance year (after that point). Additionally, drugs not covered under an MDRP agreement or not meeting the "covered outpatient drug" definition under MDRP (e.g., vaccines, certain diabetes supplies) are excluded.' international_pricing_benchmark='The International Pricing Benchmark for an NDC-9 is the greater of two alternatives: a "Default" (Method I) Benchmark or an "Updated" (Method II) Benchmark. Both methods utilize a set of 19 reference countries, which are OECD members with a purchasing power parity-adjusted per-capita GDP of at least 60% of the U.S. and an annual GDP of at least $400 billion (e.g., Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan). Under the Default (Method I) Benchmark, CMS uses foreign pricing data from private sources (e.g., IQVIA MIDAS, Global Data POLI) for the 12 months prior to a performance year. It calculates a volume-weighted or straight average price for NDC-9 analogs in each country, and the benchmark is the *lowest* country average price. This benchmark is fixed for the entire model period once set, and a 102% adjuster is applied. The Updated (Method II) Benchmark allows manufacturers to voluntarily submit their own international net pricing data for all analogs of a GUARD drug in all 19 countries. This benchmark is the *cross-country weighted average net price* and can be updated annually with manufacturer submissions. A higher 105% adjuster is applied to incentivize data submission. All pricing data is adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).' benchmark_comparison="The GUARD Model's International Pricing Benchmark is determined by selecting the *greater* of two methodologies: the Default (Method I) or the Updated (Method II) benchmark. The Default (Method I) benchmark, calculated by CMS, identifies the *lowest* country average price among the 19 reference countries, using publicly available or proprietary data sources that likely reflect list prices. This benchmark is fixed for the model's duration and is subject to a 102% adjuster. In contrast, the Updated (Method II) benchmark relies on *voluntarily submitted manufacturer net pricing data* to calculate a *cross-country weighted average net price* across the same 19 reference countries. This benchmark can be updated annually and includes a higher 105% adjuster, potentially incentivizing manufacturers to provide their own data. Manufacturers must strategically evaluate whether relying on CMS's potentially higher list-price-based lowest country average (Method I) or submitting their own net prices, which might result in a higher cross-country average but also a higher adjuster (Method II), is more advantageous for each specific drug, considering international pricing and discounting practices. Both methods apply GDP (PPP) adjustments." enforcement_and_penalties="Manufacturers failing to timely pay an Incremental GUARD Model rebate within 30 days will incur a Civil Monetary Penalty (CMP) equal to 125% of the unpaid rebate amount, in addition to the underlying rebate. Knowingly failing to comply with GUARD Model requirements, including data agreement provisions, also subjects manufacturers to a CMP. CMS reserves the right to refer non-compliance cases to the HHS Office of the Inspector General, the Department of Justice, or the Treasury Department. Additionally, CMS may terminate data agreements, demand further information, or impose increased monitoring or auditing for non-compliance or submission of false data. While manufacturers can appeal CMPs, there are no appeal rights regarding CMS's selection of model drugs, beneficiaries, geographic areas, the total GUARD Model rebate amount, or specific data inputs or calculations related to the rebate amount. The CMP notice, hearing, and appeal procedures align with those of the Part D inflation rebate program." what_you_need_to_know=['The GUARD Model is a mandatory Most Favored Nation (MFN) drug pricing initiative for certain Medicare Part D drugs, proposed to take effect on January 1, 2027, with a five-year performance period.', 'It targets sole-source drugs and biologics in 17 specific therapeutic categories with high Part D spending, excluding generics, biosimilars, and drugs already subject to Medicare Drug Price Negotiation.', "Rebates are calculated based on the difference between a drug's Medicare net price and an international benchmark derived from prices in 19 OECD reference countries, adjusted for purchasing power parity.", 'Manufacturers face mandatory participation and significant civil monetary penalties (125% of unpaid rebate) for non-compliance, with limited administrative and judicial review rights over rebate calculations.', 'While the model aims to reduce drug costs for Medicare, CMS acknowledges it will have only an indirect impact, if any, on Medicare Part D enrollee out-of-pocket costs.', "This policy represents a continuation of the Trump Administration's MFN-based drug pricing strategies, which have historically faced industry opposition and legal challenges."] implications_for_pharma_companies=['**Mandatory Participation and Increased Rebate Liability**: Manufacturers of eligible sole-source Part D drugs will be compelled to participate, potentially incurring substantial new rebate liabilities if their U.S. Medicare net prices exceed the international benchmark.', "**Complex Data Strategy and Administrative Burden**: Companies must decide whether to rely on CMS's default benchmark (Method I) or voluntarily submit their own international net pricing data (Method II). This decision requires intricate analysis of global pricing, discounting, and the impact of different adjusters (102% vs. 105%), leading to significant administrative and resource demands for data collection and calculation.", "**Pressure on Gross-to-Net Revenue**: The imposition of additional rebates will likely exert considerable pressure on manufacturers' gross-to-net revenue, potentially impacting financial forecasts, investment in research and development, and overall profitability.", '**Potential for Price Adjustments**: To mitigate rebate liabilities, manufacturers may consider adjusting U.S. launch prices or net prices, which could trigger cascading effects on pricing strategies in other U.S. markets and internationally.', '**Heightened Regulatory Scrutiny and Legal Challenges**: The model is expected to face strong industry opposition and potential legal challenges, similar to previous MFN proposals. Pharmaceutical companies will need to closely monitor ongoing regulatory and legal developments and prepare for potential litigation.', '**Government Price Reporting Nuances**: While GUARD Model rebates appear to be excluded from Medicaid Best Price and Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) calculations, indirect impacts on these metrics and the 340B Ceiling Price are still a possibility if manufacturers alter their pricing strategies in response to the model.']
