Sole source drugs include single source drugs (NDAs with no therapeutic equivalents) and biologics (BLAs not reference for biosimilars). Exclusions include generics (except authorized), biosimilars, drugs selected for Medicare Maximum Fair Price (MFP) negotiation, and drugs not meeting a minimum Part D spend threshold ($69 million for 2027, adjusted annually). Drugs that become multi-source during a performance year are no longer subject to GUARD after that point. Units purchased under the 340B Drug Discount Program and compounded drugs are also excluded.",
        "international_pricing_benchmark": "The International Pricing Benchmark for an NDC-9 is the greater of two alternatives: a 'Default' Benchmark (Method I) or an 'Updated' Benchmark (Method II). Both methods use prices from 19 OECD countries with a purchasing power parity-adjusted per-capita GDP of at least 60% of the U.S. and an annual GDP of at least $400 billion. The Default Benchmark is the lowest country average price derived from CMS-obtained foreign pricing data (e.g., IQVIA MIDAS, POLI) for the 12 months prior to a performance year, adjusted by 102%. The Updated Benchmark is a cross-country volume-weighted average net price based on data voluntarily submitted by manufacturers, adjusted by 105%. Both benchmarks are adjusted for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) using GDP per capita.",
        "benchmark_comparison": "The Default Benchmark (Method I) is based on CMS-sourced data, often reflecting list prices, and is the lowest country average price among the 19 reference countries. It is fixed for the entire model period once set and applies a 102% adjuster. In contrast, the Updated Benchmark (Method II) relies on manufacturer-submitted net pricing data, calculating a cross-country volume-weighted average net price. This benchmark can float annually with new submissions and applies a higher 105% adjuster, incentivizing data submission. Manufacturers must weigh the advantage of potentially higher net prices from their own data (Method II) against the lower single-country average from CMS's list price data (Method I), considering the different adjusters and the complexity of foreign net price calculations.",
        "enforcement_and_penalties": "Manufacturers failing to timely pay the incremental GUARD Model rebate are subject to a civil monetary penalty (CMP) of 125% of the unpaid rebate amount, in addition to the underlying rebate. The CMP notice, hearing, and appeal procedures mirror those of the Part D inflation rebate program. CMS may also refer non-compliance cases to the HHS Office of the Inspector General, the Department of Justice, or the Treasury Department. Additionally, CMS can reconcile errors for up to five years after the final report. Administrative and judicial review of CMS determinations regarding rebate amounts or drug eligibility are precluded.",

            "Data Submission Complexity: Deciding whether to voluntarily submit international net pricing data (Method II) is critical. While it offers a potentially higher benchmark (cross-country average with 105% adjuster), it demands extensive, granular data collection and calculation of foreign net prices, for which CMS guidance is still pending.",
            "Impact on Pricing Strategy: The model will exert downward pressure on U.S. net prices, as the Medicare Net Price is compared against an international benchmark. This could influence launch prices and overall pricing strategies.",

Method I is the lowest per unit country-level price identified by CMS from private data sources (e.g., IQVIA MIDAS, POLI) for a fixed benchmark quarter, adjusted by up to 2%. Method II is a volume-weighted average net price across reference countries, based on data voluntarily submitted by manufacturers for an applicable ASP calendar quarter, adjusted by 5%. Both benchmarks also include an add-on percentage amount equal to the Medicare Part B drug payment limit add-on (generally 6%).",
        "benchmark_comparison": "Method I (Default) for GLOBE is CMS-calculated, identifying the lowest country-level price from private data sources, which may not reflect full discounts. This benchmark is fixed for the model's duration and includes a de minimis adjustment of up to 2%. Method II (Voluntary) allows manufacturers to submit their own international net pricing data to calculate a volume-weighted average net price across countries. This benchmark floats quarterly and includes a higher 5% adjustment, intended to account for greater price variations in actual transactions abroad and to incentivize data submission. Manufacturers must strategically evaluate whether submitting their own data, despite the higher adjustment, could result in a more favorable benchmark than the CMS-determined lowest country price.",
        "enforcement_and_penalties": "Manufacturers failing to timely pay the incremental GLOBE Model rebate are subject to a civil monetary penalty (CMP) equal to at least 125% of the incremental rebate amount due, in addition to the unpaid rebate. A manufacturer knowingly failing to comply with model requirements, including data agreement provisions, also faces CMPs. CMS may take additional enforcement actions, such as terminating data agreements, requiring more information, or subjecting manufacturers to additional monitoring/auditing. Submitting false data or being subject to fraud investigations can also lead to CMPs or data agreement termination. Appeals rights are limited to CMPs, with no appeal for CMS's selection of drugs, beneficiaries, geographic areas, or rebate calculations.",
